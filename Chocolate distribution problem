Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

class Solution
{
    public long findMinDiff (ArrayList<Integer> a, int n, int m)
    {
        Collections.sort(a);
      long res=a.get(m-1)-a.get(0);
      
      for(int i=1;i<=n-m;i++){
          
          res=Math.min(res,a.get(i+m-1)-a.get(i));
      }
      return res;
      
    }
}
